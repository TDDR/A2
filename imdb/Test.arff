'I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it  and heavily. But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred. After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote  or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? Nuts to that  I said. So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this show  an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad  general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with  and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell. <br /><br />Except.. <br /><br />Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell  Americas Greatest Comic Character Actor. This guy plays Belushis brother-in-law  Andy  and he is gold. How good is he really? Well  aside from being funny  his job is to make Belushi look good. Thats like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything hes in!',neg
'1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses. It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways. In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess..). Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when its finally revealed why they are getting fired  then re-hired  then fired again  then re-hired again. This is definetly made by people who dont understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.). Even my kids didnt seem to care for this boring `adventure in the make-believe. Lets see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults. Well see what happens then.',neg
'This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles  it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed  but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which I might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. The casting in this movie wasnt very good  and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didnt fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent  1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy  but with this kind of movie  in some of the more serious scenes  her acting was laughable. When she made some of her fighting poses  I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing  for example  the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing  how her voice turns dark and evil  I think that was incredibly stupid  and how Wendys (Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks  that was pretty ridiculous to. So to sumamrize it all  a disappointing movie  but okay if youre 10 or under.',neg
'The most interesting thing about Miryang (Secret Sunshine) is the actors. Jeon Do-yeon  as Lee Shin-ae  the main character  is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident  and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang  which was his home town  with her young son. Jeons face is very changeable. She is girlish  flirtatious  elegant  aged and sad  desperate and joyous  with it and terribly isolated by turns  and its all in her face. The film also stars Song Kang-ho as Kim  a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang  who happens to run a garage in town  and who follows her around all the time thereafter  despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions. Song is the biggest star in Korea right now  renowned for his work with Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance; Memories of Murder and The Host). And yet here he plays a throwaway character  almost a forgotten man. But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing. He is the essential ballast to keep Jeons character from floating away.<br /><br />Lee Shin-ae is a piano teacher. She comes to the new town  which is a neutral place  a kind of poor-mans Seoul  a town just like anywhere else  as Kim says (just as he is in a way just like anyone else). Her little boy is sprightly  as little boys are  but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too. His father used to snore  and when he misses him he lies awake  pretending to snore. He goes to school  and Shin-ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers. There is a sense of place in the film  even though the place is in a sense anywhere. People speak in the local dialect  and everyone knows everything  and Shin-aes Seoul origin is immediately noticed. Is life really harsher here  away from the big city and its sophistication? Shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is in.<br /><br />Something terrible happens. And Shin-ae doesnt necessarily deal with it in the best possible way. But it happens and she must face the consequences. But she cant. She goes to pieces. A perpetrator is caught  but thats no consolation. Eventually she becomes so despairing  she relents and goes to a born-again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend. She finds peace and release with this. But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so  that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again. She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion. And it gets worse than that.<br /><br />Jeon Do-yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role. Lee Chang-dong may be a very good director. If an actor of the stature of Song Kang-ho expresses enormous admiration for him  that is convincing. According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly  Lees first three films  Green Fish (1997)  Peppermint Candy (2000) and Oasis (2002) have marked him out as one of the leading figures of his countrys recent cinematic renaissance. But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work Ive seen  such as Yong Sang-Soo  Bong Joon-ho  and the prodigiously  almost perversely gifted Park Chan-wook. It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of Asiatic Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore and then abruptly and without warning turns into something of a thriller  and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering. But that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out  with no sense of an ending. There are also weaknesses in the action. Shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son  and makes bad choices all along. If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean-Jacques Beineixs Betty Blue  which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices  that isnt something that is properly developed. This is an interesting film  certainly a disturbing one  but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied  after putting one through an emotional wringer.<br /><br />An official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center  2007?an event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past.',pos
'when i first read about berlin am meer i didnt expect much. but i thought with the right people  the right locations  the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed  its so ridiculously unauthentic. its a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlins so called scene. of course its not all about hippness  but you should expect more from a movie thats being sold as the definite berlin movie.<br /><br />and apart from all the credibility stuff  it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented. so it really must be poor directing skills.<br /><br />dont bother watching berlin am meer unless you are 17  come from some small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school. then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool.',neg
'I saw this film on September 1st  2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.<br /><br />This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time  it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen  and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop  this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young  working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world  Harry Vardon.<br /><br />And the story is inspirational. Against all odds  Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of Holes) gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared  and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps  Francis displays courage  spirit  heroism  and humility at this world class event.<br /><br />And  we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example  the use of small wooden clubs  the layout of the short holes  the manual scoreboard  the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths  the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways  and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.<br /><br />This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars  the story is somehow more believable.<br /><br />This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of Miracle and Remember the Titans.<br /><br />FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.',pos
'I saw a screening of this movie last night. I had high expectations going into it  but was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of the opening  Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there goes all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour are hilarious. Dont get me wrong  the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour  it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less of a comedy  and more of a thriller/drama/love story...which is pointless. the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs interspersed here and there  but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning. at one point  the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled boooo during a very confusingly emotional scene. Williams gives a great performance  right on par with his comedic style. Walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can. I think the one character that goes underrated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political  its funny to see him tone it down for a PG-13 rating. Overall  I would not pay to see the movie. Afterall  I saw it for free and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid  and its all downhill from there. Not really fitting into a category  the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special. 4.5/10',neg
'William Hurt may not be an American matinee idol anymore  but he still has pretty good taste in B-movie projects. Here  he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run --played by former pretty-boy Weller-- who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. Current pretty-boy Hardy Kruger Jr --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as Wellers arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest for hero Hurt. Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you cant wait for.

'I had a recent spectator experience with The Perfect Witness (2007) because the NetFlix computer recommendation engine suggested I watch this film. Apparently  at some point  I told it how much I liked Michael Hanekes  Bennys Video. I dont know about you  but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C. Dunns film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse. Just this kind of recommendation from the NetFlix computer intelligence  for me  had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that  upon reflection  it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007.<br /><br />Having prefaced my response to the film that way  Im going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and I really hate to do that because I think our boy  Wes Bentley  happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema  but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the US. Im more than moderately concerned that the poor guys going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this.<br /><br />The Perfect Witness is about Micky (Wes Bentley)  who  about thirty  still lives with Mom (Youre not drinkin again area yas?)  but hes a filmmaker or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B. Out there  doing his private investigator-like drills  Micky inadvertently video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder. Baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films)  Micky approaches the assailant  James LeMac (Mark Borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or Mac the Knife ?whichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses  holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do. While both the writing and direction are amateurish  that alone doesnt make a film bad. Its that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little Mac or PC. No film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course  ironically  its a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes. Also  weve got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up  real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it  backwards  just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest ?same guy who just now calls himself a poet.<br /><br />Spare me. Im an artist  Im a filmmaker. Okay. Please do  carry on with that shtick  Cronnie. Seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock. And go ahead  you can wear all the accrutements of a creative but dont expect us top respond to you  to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down Wes Bentleys career. Why dont we just let history speak to the merits of what you do  filmmaker guy. My guess is history will eventually have say something about that ?like  probably thats in not is good as you think it is. And yeah  odds are youll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma  end up like our man Micky here in The Perfect Witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddys blood with a video camera in your hand.

'Didnt the writer for this movie see the other three? I loved the original  I thought 2 was the best  I tolerated 3 (it was OK  nothing special). But I HATED this one. Who dare they kill off UG? This was certainly not the Ug who had been almost like a brother to Charlie in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said  You wouldnt just leave me on Earth  would you. Ug replied  Charlie  Bounty Hunter  saying that he was now one of them now. How dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who gets killed by Charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was getting boring. In fact for the first 20 minutes  we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to Charlie  who was the hero weve been waiting to see. I kept waiting saying  Come on  whens Charlie going to appear? Angela Basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this Turkey. Moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the writers decided  that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted. This movie is totally out of line with the first two. And it didnt even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger Children. 4 is just ugly and mean-spirited (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated  hated  hated it. I hated the fact that anyone could like it and I hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. I give this a one start simply because IMDb.com wont let me give it a zero.',neg
'This movie was really bad. First they didnt even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Geins victims. The acting was horrible  except for the guy playing Ed Gein  but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up  but it didnt need to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.',neg
'I think I watched a highly edited version because it wasnt nearly as graphic as I expected - based on the other reviews that I have heard.<br /><br />Other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original Emmanuelle (1974)  Emmanuelle Arsan  2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit  and 3. being set in the exotic locale of Asia  Laure doesnt have the same flair as its predecessor.<br /><br />I just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that Im really not that interested in  i.e. the voyeuristic  open relationship between Laure and Nick  Im just happy with whatever brings her pleasure...something along those lines. I cannot relate to this mentality and the film/characters dont really shed any light.<br /><br />The second half about finding the Mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. One that I didnt care for. By that time  I was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest.<br /><br />Maybe I just didnt get it.<br /><br />Ill leave it at that.',neg
'Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So  as an adaptation  its a success.<br /><br />Unfortunately  its still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here  so dont expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have its moment  Postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through.<br /><br />At its core  Postal is a satire on the United States  as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive  the funnier  and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes  some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself  and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.<br /><br />After the initial surprise wears off  Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes  but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.<br /><br />This probably would have worked as a short movie  but its just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice tries  but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10',neg

'Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably  their undeniable  but rather soft and flabby than steamy  erotic qualities non withstanding.<br /><br />Senso 45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century  1945 to be exact  so there are Mussolini murals  men in black shirts  German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing  the historic context is completely negligible.<br /><br />Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive  versatile  well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom  loathing  delight  fear  hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. She endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts come along for her. She really deserves it.',neg

'Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again  which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real  they were important  they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics  well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy  classic pop tunes  the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. Beatle fans may argue that Hard Days Night was better and I am sure that many of the kids think 8 Mile was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as Head and that is probably why it failed.<br /><br />If Head had told a direct A to B type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. Could you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5\% (and I am being generous) of the acts are white. If you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the Monkess to sing Hey  Hey we are the Monkees. You know we like to please. A manufactured image  with no philosophy. When you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dancing  and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.<br /><br />The story  what there is  concerns the boys trying to flee their manager  who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial  but every time they run away they end up inside a box. I dont think you need to be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. Some neat little comedy bits follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and Peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. Even if you are put off by the story  you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.<br /><br />Any film that begins and ends with Mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.',pos

'This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible  the script made me cringe  the effects are completely lousy (which I usually dont mind for older films  but this was made just two years ago)  and everything about it just annoys me.

It has minimal gore and no nudity  which made a bad film even worse. Heck  the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene  and even that could of been better.<br /><br />Honestly  dont even waste your time watching it on cable  and certainly dont consider buying or renting this  else youll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.',neg

Weve seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. A big cat will run if it can  but if it cant it will charge as a final act of desperation. Where a T.Rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior simply has not been observed. With these larger animals  safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile  and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. With a T.Rex  of course  this could be a serious problem. Ive seen a T.Rex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them  they wouldnt just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! <br /><br />So here we have Cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign  apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of T.Rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards  Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them. OK  maybe they dont have M-16s like the guys in the Carnosaur series  but they _do_ have flintlocks  crossbows  pointed sticks (big ones  made from trees) and swords. Maybe thats a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto  but theyve several guys and Id quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. Oh  wait  theres a _cannon_  about a 4-incher. Thats just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus skull! So they lay a trap  with a squad of men  cannon  pointed sticks in a ravine  and lure the first T.Rex into it  using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that theyll NOT have time to reload  so theyll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. T.Rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire  and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it. End of credibility. A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez torso armor  and a 4 cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide  ribcage  or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4 cannon ball?) And heres T.Rex  still standing  not even bleeding. So Cortez lures it to the ravine  where it falls onto the pointed sticks  which (I guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it. Yaaay  pointed sticks! <br /><br />The dinos arent completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. This runs it off  so its NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo  at least in the movies.<br /><br />They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. My money would still be on the cannon. Its engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowders energy in one direction - toward the target. A bomb is a much more diffused application of force. A _real_ bomb (NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. (Think: pipe bomb vs firecracker.) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF. (Trust me on that one.)',neg
'i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. ive never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just dont make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness)  im even more amazed that this film even got finished  yet alone turn out so great.<br /><br />the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the films greatest asset. you actually FEEL like your in Vietnam.<br /><br />all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being Robert Duvall (I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!) martin sheen  and the great Marlon Brando.<br /><br />a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky  weird and cerebral near the end. well  remeber what Coppolla said about this movie  This film is not about vietnam  it IS vietnam! what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not the war.<br /><br />this movie is based on the short story Heart of darkness by Joseph Conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.<br /><br />this is perfect  challenging film that is dark  violent  humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.<br /><br />a true classic<br /><br />rating:10',pos
'Like several other reviewers here  Im surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. Dan OBannons previous effort was the groundbreaking Alien of 1979. Because it and Star Wars introduced the stylistic approach of Used or Dirty Space in art-direction for these kinds of features doesnt mean that this was the only way to produce them.<br /><br />Rather than dismiss Lifeforce out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature  its important to recognize that the film draws upon the esteemed traditions of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass (specifically Quatermass and the Pit  1967)  Doctor Who and The Day of the Triffids (1963)  if not the works of Gerry Anderson (UFO  Space:1999 and Thunderbirds). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer OBannons genre-scholarly appreciation for Queen of Blood(1966) and It! The Terror from Beyond Space(1958) - the immediate sources for Alien (1979).<br /><br />Granted this film has some legacy elements  but perhaps its worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981s An American Werewolf in London and The Company of Wolves (1984) - other 80s films that share a looking-back while they adapt those stories to the 80s zeitgeist. All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same  but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could)  and  at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek  humorous aspects of their projects.<br /><br />Neil Jordans Wolves played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the 80s  while American Werewolf curdled its theme as a coming-of-age film. Its called artistic license  and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the Scream franchise  I Know What You Did Last Summer and Final Destination. But these teen-targeted  films seem to be part of a box-office trend  whereas the 80s films like Lifeforce belong a canon of British sci-fi - even if this one was written by an American.<br /><br />In many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks (Independence Day  Armageddon  Deep Impact) in that the solutions dont reside in gun-battles  weaponized payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole  it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didnt examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade Solaris...<br /><br />The goal of this film was fun  not ponderousness or stupidity.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'Film version of Sandra Bernhards one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars  but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting  and fitfully funny. Her fans will say shes scathingly honest  and that may be true. But shes also shrill  with an unapologetic  in-your-face bravado that isnt well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesnt want to make nice--and shes certainly not out to make friends--and thats always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway  her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and  though not directed by him  the film does have his chilly  detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandras in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****',neg
'Spoken like a true hard-boiled uan gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks  but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II  or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.<br /><br />But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake uan accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia  but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.<br /><br />Ah well  the script aint too hot either. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him  smiling and patting him on the back all the while.',neg
'I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOWs performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too  but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid  boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasnt suspenseful at all  i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake  its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too  but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.',neg
'This movie is good for entertainment purposes  but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `Oh I want to learn more about Custers life and his last stand  do not rent `They Died with Their Boots On. But  if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film  with a little bit of romance and just for a good story  this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />The story starts out with Custers (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles  including his battle in the Civil War. The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. In between the battle scenes  he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland).<br /><br />Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant  but suave George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute  sweet Libby very well  especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. The acting in general was impressive  especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script  at times  was corny  although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The directors portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him.<br /><br />I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.',pos
'I vaguely remember this film. I do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that I have ever walked out on!! and since then I have never seen it available to rent ANYWHERE!! I cant spoil it for anyone cos I can barely remember it!! To think  looking at the cast  it seemed a winner  with John Landis directing  but good god  they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel!! All I can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him  by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer. I walked out after about half an hour of this. I must confess though  Id love to see if I can get a copy  just to see if it really was that bad!!<br /><br />It wouldnt surprise me if this was on every actors black list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this?? The legend of all bad guys  whod been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings?? As I said - black listed movie  The Stupids!',neg
'One of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours  ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is  as usual  brilliant. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine  but then proving to be intelligent and caring  as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent  as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama  but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that restore ones faith in television drama  whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.',pos
'My name is John Mourby and this is my story about Paperhouse: In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcocks psycho  I was very scared and deeply disturbed. I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way. But none where satisfactory. Amongst those tried and failed were The Birds  Night of the Living Dead  The Silence of the Lambs  The Blair Witch Project  Ring  The Evil Dead  The Sixth Sense  28 Days Later  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Halloween  Near Dark  Alien  Peeping Tom  The Cell  Rosemarys Baby  Dont Look Now  Witchfinder General  Friday the 13th and The Omen. That should confirm I was desperate! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse ??.<br /><br />Paperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own  called Marianne Dreams. Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films  but they didnt tell me about the link between book and film. I discovered the truth while on the Internet  I bought the film later that day.<br /><br />I thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull. Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not. It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same. One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and I mean genuinely unnerving). More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld  EG an apple tree. Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world. Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house  obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark cant walk. So Anna decides to draw her father in. she gets her pencil out and gets too work  but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes. Quote he looks like madman. So Anna tries to rub him out and start again  but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out). Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her fathers eyes! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br />Paperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset. But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years. The question is how dose the compare with Psycho? Answer  1 the old dark house  2 psychological parental fears  3 a genuine shock  4 and very scary music.',pos
'This Harold Lloyd short wasnt really much; not one of his funnier efforts. Of course  I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. Thats what the bulk of this story is  Harold and his wife  Mildred Davis  babysitting his in-laws two young kids. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house. Half the time its the pet cat scaring the couple  but overall  that segment is fun with some good sight gags  reminding me of another Lloyd short  Haunted Spooks.<br /><br />However  the good ending doesnt save the whole picture  which I probably wouldnt watch again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It just isnt that funny.',neg

This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children.

'Misty Ayers had a smoking body  and thats all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself  counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: casually walking into a room and saying Hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic. Id like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: that womens low-rise panties existed in 1954. Im talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties  sadly). Also includes horrendous dubbing  leading to a Look out!

'Yes  this film has many gay characters. It also has straight characters  characters who are not sure about their sexuality  people who are searching for some truth about their existence. <br /><br />This is not a film about sexual orientation. Its about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. Filmically  Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting  constantly shifting relationships. The serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and  unlike the rest of the film  is thematically heavy-handed). <br /><br />Thomas Gibson centers and grounds the film; its a quiet performance but behind the handsome  arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. The supporting cast is strong  especially Mia Kirshner as Gibsons friend  a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. Her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time  she represents the light and dark of the characters sexual consciousness. <br /><br />The films involving and often surprises in its character development. The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman directing a David Mamet script---the dialogue doesnt shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. Often  in our search for love and a conventional relationship  we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends  family  those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and the writer  Brad Fraser  make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.<br /><br />This film is a rewarding experience. It may not be for bigots who cant get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater  transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this  that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye  deserves applause and an open-minded approach.',pos
'The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting. The whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that I started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film. An even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character. The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Husseys innovative visual effects. However  as eye-catching as they may be  they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above. A dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing. I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.',neg

'A sentimental  heart-tugging family film set in England of the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National; fortunately  ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is around to give Liz some help. Director Clarence Brown displays some remarkable control with material that couldve been excessively maudlin in someone elses hands. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. True  there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced  but overall its quite affecting  and gorgeously filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite thrilling  and like so many great classics  theres a marvelous  three-hankie fade-out at the end. Liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start  and Rooney--who I usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrif as Lizs gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight as her older  boy-crazy sister. Most of the acting kudos  however  belong to Anne Revere  who won a richly deserved Supporting Actress Oscar playing Lizs wise and caring mother.',pos

'I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head away  I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music Id heard  having been a strictly folky  classical kid growing up. The music mesmerized me  as did Hazel OConnors amazing look and charismatic vocal performances  and Phil Daniels tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryces drugged out sax player. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic  he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes  the performance when the lights went out  and the love scene on the train.<br /><br />Okay  so the movie isnt the Rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80s  exploding with rebellious youth  looking for a way out of the dole queue.

'This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. Its exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However  what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on  sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film  well  not a proper one at least.',neg

'Movies like this one  and C.R.A.Z.Y.  make me very sad for American films with a gay subject matter. With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain  there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie  The Bubble. This movie centers on two men  Noam and Ashwar  an Israle and Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples  in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next  or who will say I love you first. Noam and Ashwars early love is complicated by suicide bombings  armed security check points  and racism. While Noams friends accept and like Ashwar  who is Arab  it is clear that most of Tel Avivs citizens probably dont.<br /><br />One of the most touching moments  and there are many in this film  is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of Bent. We  as movie goers  see them watching this play  and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. And ultimately  this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller and Youseff Joe Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. And while most movies today have sex in them  (almost as a sport)  this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. It is so refreshing. Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. It just doesnt happen to be the two gay guys for a change. Somewhere on this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and Friends. Well  not really. Yes  these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships. But I dont recall getting blowed up as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in Friends.<br /><br />This is a very good movie. It has heart  and heartbreak. And like all good love stories love does win out. But not in its intact glory of full bloom . Still  its a very satisfying movie to watch.',pos
'Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid  redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal Crocodile (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and ? on top of that ? it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old  over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film  he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this  the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. Theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid! Early in the film  one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielbergs great white shark. The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again.

It has the same elements of Casablanca  but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior.

'After eagerly waiting to the end  I have to say I wish I wouldnt have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years  but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say  seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others dont count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say  journey is more important than the destination. Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing  returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever.',neg

'*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />I thought Pitch Black to be quite enjoyable  with some nice effects--I liked the larger beasts  although they arent a patch on the Aliens from the Alien series.

If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight  where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain?<br /><br />I liked the fact that Fry died at the end--it reminded me of the New Hollywood films of the 1970s  with the main heroine not making it to the end.',pos

'The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty  as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol  comes across as a pleasant  girl-next-door type  who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasnt anything wrong with it). Director Mary Harron  who also made I Shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho  recreates Bettys America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new  degraded  black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager  color is introduced. Bettys notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor  in a great performance  and Chris Bauer)  as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Bettys bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community. Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety  although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the films third act is virtually non-existent  we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside  its a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.',pos
'This movie was unbelievably bad... Its gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. Since Everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot... what plot? There really isnt any! The pacing is unbelievably slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why... not because of the gore (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. It should have been BANNED from existence. Avoid this one like the plague. 1 out of 10',neg

'I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. Ive been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual  textural  sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didnt care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didnt know what had happened when the movie was over  but I find life is that way. It didnt bother me. The unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real. I loved the faces  the way the camera dwelt upon them. The camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was real to me in a way movies arent. It was exactly the lack of explanation  color  sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. Someday I will own it.',pos

Ms. Merkerson will blow you away  as will the young man playing the young lead.<br /><br />I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented. <br /><br />The music is a blast  too. Nice selections to represent mood  time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. <br /><br />This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!',pos
'The most satisfying element about Dan in Real Life is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dans love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented  intelligent  naturally attractive and  thank goodness  appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson  it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about Dan in Real Life is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the frat pack formula: dumb chicks  chauvinistic guys  and sleazy jokes. Dan in Real Life is witty and has fun  intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing  the jokes from Dan in Real Life are more natural and clever  and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with Dan in Real Life is that the rebellious  middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. Its difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way  her character is unrealistic and annoying. But  this is only a minor flaw in the film  and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all  Dan in Real Life is a great film  a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing  directing  acting  and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful  light-hearted comedy.',pos
'What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film? And not only did he remake it  completely ruin it? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most overdone performance  and thats saying a lot) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous  and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese especially)- attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back.

'If youve ever seen an eighties slasher  there isnt much reason to see this one. Originality often isnt one of slasher cinemas strongpoints  and its something that this film is seriously lacking in. There really isnt much that can said about Pranks  so Ill make this quick. The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list  and that was my only reason for seeing it. The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As theyre in a slasher  someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because  despite a few gory scenes  this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone  and gorier slashers than this (Friday the 13th  for example) didnt end up banned. But then again  theres banned films that are much less gory than this one (The Witch Who Came from the Sea  for example). Anyway  the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it  as although the audience really couldnt care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done. On the whole  this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.',neg
'Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.Yet again another difficult film to purchase in the UK.I had to go through Midnight Video who have a Swedish branch.I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only SKR30 a title.<br /><br />This film goes under many a.k.as depending on when and where it is marketed.I had previously purchased The Bloodsucker leads the Dance (which you will find if you search on Imdb under people and input Krista Nell).The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from Italian into English by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell.<br /><br />There are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion  sleazy affairs with girlfriends mothers  a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit  a gangrape by a clients motorcycle friends  sleazy photography  cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - SLEAZE  (but artistic sleaze).The aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other Imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and whyfores.Personally I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.Also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long  having made their point  so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and I was left wanting more from her  the director and the screenplay.<br /><br />I love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such.',neg
'Remake of the classic 1951 The Thing From Another World. 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon  nobody trusts anyone else--theyre isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?<br /><br />The 1951 film had the thing just be a big  super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette Who Goes There?) and its scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricones extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. Theres blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off  heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I dont scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottins effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!<br /><br />It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside  it is very suspenseful. Youre not sure who is what and Carpenters direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. Thats annoying...but the movie still works.<br /><br />This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with E.T. and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. Its now considered one of John Carpenters best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!<br /><br />An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that theyd have to be close to a facility to throw up!',pos
'I didnt even watch this whole movie. Now  I like 50s sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing  one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league  not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says Can you see Brooklyn? and another guy says Sure. And the boob says Gee  I wonder whos pitching? Pardon me a moment  I think my sides are splitting.<br /><br />When they first get up into orbit the boob says The moon is just for looking at! Take me back down! Watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the films best moment can be identified by a big THE END on the screen.)<br /><br />We also find out that they cant open the hatch because the boob greased it before they took off. Sure  a space vehicle is going to be greased by a member of the crew  who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesnt know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said  That sounds logical! The no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad its painful to watch. (Everyone knows  in the absence of gravity  everything tends to go UP.)<br /><br />How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10  when other vastly superior films dont rate any higher  is a mystery to me. I really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic  and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. I think in retrospect its not the whole movie I hate so much as the fact that the boob is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to grease the hatch. OMG. I wonder if he checked the fan belts too. Maybe if theyd left the boob off the trip it might not have been QUITE so excruciating. Even so  its only average. What everyone else is raving about  I dont know.<br /><br />You want to watch a neat 1950s space movie? Rocketship X-M beats it all to heck. Maybe not so much realism but a more serious story and less goofy characters.',neg

In the Extras of the DVD  the director Roberto Moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines  only the description of the situations  and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings. The actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation  being the reason for such natural acting. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Contra Todos (Against Everybody)',pos

'Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. Theyve been making these lame Jaws-copies since the 70s  its not like theyre getting any more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts murdering people. First it takes down some secondary characters  then it starts attacking the main characters  usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous  who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow  usually with an explosion. Then  we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive  or has laid eggs  etc. etc. Krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas  and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation. Unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation  in that case your standards are pretty low.

'<br /><br />Summary: Not worth the film<br /><br />As an avid Gone With the Wind fan  I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily  the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out  I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality  it remains a good story  and  as long as I was able to separate it from the original  was and still is enjoyable. However  I consider the six hours I spent watching the Scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchells book  this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape  mistrust  murder  and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film  and even carried through in the second book  and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel  Scarlett OHara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an arrangement with Rhett  she agrees to leave  and proceeds to reconnect with her OHara relatives in Savannah. Eventually  she accompanies her cousin Colum  a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood  to Ireland  to further explore her familys roots that go deep  and is eventually named The OHara  the head of the family. While her duties as The OHara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara  Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners  and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She  having been scorned by Rhett time and time again  eventually agrees to marry Luke  the earl of Fenton  until Rhett comes along in a clichéd night-on-white-horse - type of a rescue. The Scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family  the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.<br /><br />I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.<br /><br />',neg

'Culled from the real life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890s New York  The Bowery is high energy and good natured.<br /><br />But be warned: Casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot might be startling. This is true to the time it was set and the time it was made. And it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods. It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere.<br /><br />Beery as Connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action  a loud-mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade. And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper. Raft as Brodie is Connors slicker  better looking rival in almost every endeavor. Brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention  leading up to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy).<br /><br />Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on Irish-American accent. He is just the gruff sort of character to draw children  cats and ladies in distress. This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft ever played  and he even gets to throw in a little dancing (as well as a show of leg). And again he mistakes the leading lady (lovely Fay Wray) for a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as either of them  though he gets a chance to turn on the tears.<br /><br />The highlight isnt the jump off the bridge but a no-holds-barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals. Its sure someone bruised more than an ego.',pos
'What the heck was this. Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music  CGI  or acting.<br /><br />The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynchs work feels like that at times  and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long. And sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The cast was attractive  and that is about the limit to this. I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have  but just doesnt make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates...whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.',neg
'I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any American musical films. IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.<br /><br />Its a pity because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it. Fred Astaire  story and adapted to screen by author P.G. Wodehouse  Burns&Allen for comedy  and songs by the Gershwin Brothers. In answer to the question posed by the Nice Work If You Can Get It  there isnt much you could ask more for this film.<br /><br />Except a leading lady. Though Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire  Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire.<br /><br />Her character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogerss parts do in these films. All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure. She also doesnt contribute anything musically. And if I had to rate all the dancing partners of Fred Astaire  Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom. The poor woman is just horrible in the Things Are Looking Up number. <br /><br />When she co-starred later on in a musical with Bing Crosby  The Emperor Waltz  its no accident that Fontaine is given nothing musical to do.<br /><br />The version I have is a colorized one and in this case I think it actually did some good. The idyllic lush green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy. Especially in that number I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine which does take place in the garden.<br /><br />Burns&Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number. The surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged.<br /><br />P.G. Wodehouses aristocracy runs the gamut with Constance Collier at her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaines father as a nice man on film.<br /><br />The biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day maybe the best known song about the British capital city since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Done in the best simple elegant manner by Fred Astaire  its one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even after.<br /><br />Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine  A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic  classic score  classic dancing  classic comedy.

'A Scanner Darkly  Minority Report  Blade Runner  Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ? if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out.<br /><br />French animation project Renaissance took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight I finally got to see it at a private screening for the International Film Festival in Stockholm. My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is huh  neat and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding meh. It is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface  but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent  as do the flat characters. <br /><br />Nevertheless it is clear that the people at Onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. The visuals are staggering. They have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation  with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background. For those of you who are not down with the technical lingo  the film looks like a fully-animated Sin City. Its fluid  transparent  dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning. Its a vision. Yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons  suspenseful music  heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking. Its every tech-nerds wet dream...<br /><br />The film zooms in on an eerily-lit  bleak  futurescape Paris in which a major corporation called Avalon has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the lovely Romola Garai). Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig) ? a man who takes the law into his own hands ? who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving Ilona. During this case  he is being aided by Illonas sister with whom he also begins a love affair. A very half-assed love affair  if I may say so.<br /><br />The world of Renaissance is remarkable. Director Christian Volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads  rats  femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum. The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story  or the film would have been too surreal for mainstream audiences  owing to its lurid animation format. It follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evil-laughing villains  sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get. It shoves noir in our faces  and it isnt necessary.<br /><br />What is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived. It seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot. This is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character. At one point in Renaissance  he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film. Unfortunately  the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and Renassaince could benefit from being slightly shorter. In summary  a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience.<br /><br />7 out of 10',pos
'There is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this. I remember feeling the same way after disliking Dogma. If you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like Mulholland Dr.  you are seen as not getting it. Of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.<br /><br />I have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has. In other words  the plot isnt structured like other films. With the case of Mulholland Dr.  it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project. It doesnt make sense  it isnt supposed to  but I know it was to be a TV series at first. It appears Lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff. You will notice that toward the end the nudity  sex and foul language increase. All things he would not have filmed for television.<br /><br />For a better film not told in a traditional  linear fashion  rent The Thin Red Line from 1998. That was a great film  this is not.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of ten',neg
'Im the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on Babbages difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc.. So  if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film  then I guess Id probably be included in that.<br /><br />Maybe I just need to watch it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired. Maybe that was my mistake.<br /><br />I tried my best to enjoy this film  and there are aspects of it that I do like  but overall I found it amateurish and quite plodding.<br /><br />Being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd  I just cant help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made  and how the employed graphics reflect that time (i.e. 1997). Having played games of the era c.f. Mind Grind to cite one example  this film cannot escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time. Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least  in favour of actual game play.<br /><br />Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel (as I dont think its ever been aired on UK FTA TV  well not recently anyway)  I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on its design. Maybe its mean spirited of me to be amused by this  given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made  nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.<br /><br />But  as for the main story  I agree that the format isnt the best idea. Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the sci-fi angle  and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.<br /><br />There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents  seems somehow ludicrous.<br /><br />Also  the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time (e.g. the winds) is now known not to be the case.<br /><br />OK  so the Victorians may have held this view  but the 20th century works of Gödel proving that no mathematical system can be complete  Turings works on the limits of computability  not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics  have all completely undermined these ideas  which seem central to how the modern day researchers software is supposed to work.<br /><br />Finally  the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean programming is also just plain wrong  as previously mentioned.<br /><br />This film maybe could have been OK  but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.<br /><br />I wont forget the film though  as like Pi  it is clearly a unique work  but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it  3/10 from me.',neg
'Ive been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and really didnt begin to love the show until Season 4 started. This episode Hush was view by me alone in the dark just after Midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm. The writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me. I was in awe the entire episode which I just finished 2 minutes ago. Amazing doesnt touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue. If youve never given this show much thought at least watch this episode. If this doesnt impress you then no episode probably will.<br /><br />BTW My Heart is still racing...',pos
'Der Todesking is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry? Jörg Buttgereits second cult monument in a row  which is actually a lot better than the infamous Nekromantik  exists of seven short episodes ? one for each day of the week ? revolving on unrelated peoples suicides. In between these already very disturbing episodes  Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes arent all equally powerful but  as a wholesome  Der Todesking is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday  involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park  and the one of Sunday  focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead  are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film  or any other shockumenary like it  is debatable and Im not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. Theres the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these peoples motivations to end their lives so dramatically. Entirely unlike I expected  Der Todesking isnt exploitative or repulsively graphic! On the contrary actually  I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this  as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names  ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism  but this isnt what really counts in this type of cinema. The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful ? but also indispensable ? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music  too!',pos
'I recently rented this promising mini series  I didnt even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book  the characters are completely miscast and theres some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen  but I think television budgets just arent big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.<br /><br />Forsyth deserves much  much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book  which is a must-read.',neg
'Maybe Im missing something because Ive read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Himself than I have read bad reviews - and I just dont get it. I like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak  look  and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor  Lee J. Cobb. His rumpled  rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing  smooth-talking noir archetype as youll find. Or  take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting Ive seen in a while. Shes just not convincing in the role.<br /><br />As for the plot  its tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre. I could have predicted the outcome of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes. And that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it.',neg
'The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer  this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions. Unfortunately  Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your basic Ten Little Indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero(ine) is left to defeat the evil. And this is exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. Production values and acting were ok  but I had no motivation to watch to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the end scene would play out. The ending did surprise me a bit  because it managed to fizzle out  literally  instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. Maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end.',neg
'8 days no script thats what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made. Its shot in blurry video thats occasionally used to good effect  but its really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. It is very well acted and this helps a lot. But the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they dont try to escape or do anything too interesting  so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. Would have been a good short maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they had no script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too many. I wonder why that is? How many great movies have been made from bad scripts. Not too many. Why is that? Working against this major problem  the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. Topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. Actors again deserve praise  if only there was a script.<br /><br />Also the video quality  or lack thereof  is really low end  they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from Miami Vice  the recent movie that is. But thats not intended to compliment Miami Vice or this failed venture.',neg
'In April 1946  the University of Chicago agreed to operate Argonne National Laboratory  with an association of Midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. Argonne thereby became the first national laboratory. It did not  however  remain at its original location in the Argonne forest. In 1947  it moved farther west from the Windy City to a new site on Illinois farmland. When Alvin Weinberg visited Argonnes director  Walter Zinn  in 1947  he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. When Zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the Materials Testing Reactor under design at Oak Ridge  Weinberg joked it would be simpler if Zinn took the Oak Ridge design and operated the Materials Testing Reactor at one-tenth capacity. The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.<br /><br />The S-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns. It was built next to the K-25 power plant  which provided the necessary steam. Much less efficient than K-25  the S-50 plant was torn down after the war.<br /><br />Concerned that the Atomic Energy Commission research program might become too academic  Lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers  and during a November visit to Oak Ridge  he discussed with Clark Center  manager of Carbide & Carbon  a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation at Oak Ridge  the possibility of the company assuming management of the Laboratory.<br /><br />Prince Henry (of Prussia) Arriving in Washington and Visiting the German Embassy (1902).

'Interesting concept that just doesnt make it. I watched the whole movie  but had to read IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 meant. If/when it was explained in the film  I must have been in a coma  or possibly brain-dead by then. I only watched it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. We all have to start somewhere  but this film should not be it. As to the anti empathy virus virus-Holy Utility Belt  Batman! Where were The Joker  The Riddler  etc? Also  why are the women all so damned ugly?

The plot is just ridiculous  the scenes are just thrown at you with no action  no start or ending of any scene.. its just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. The special effects ( Spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible  the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. I have to admin that i couldnt bear to watch it to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me.. Im sorry for my bad English.. i am from Romania ( and this is my first post ).

'Chen Kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere. Yes  its a period piece  but Chens artistic use of imagery makes it something more. The actors often behave like players using the stylized diction  postures and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play to the back wall even when addressing each other. They are like spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story with urgent meaning for those in the present.

'Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.<br /><br />Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here  but they just dont work. Actually the films ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. Given the choice Id watch Pontypool again rather than watch this film again.',neg
'This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love may come from where you dont expect it and maybe dont want it. But we both chose that love anyway.<br /><br />And no  it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos.<br /><br />When we were young we both had affairs  but never with the opposite sex. As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.<br /><br />This story is not far fetched. However  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. We are still gay. End of story.',pos
'While in her deathbed  Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name Harris and recalls the day on the 50s when she was an aspirant singer and traveled from New York to be the maid of honor of her wealthy friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) in Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) is welcomed by Lilas alcoholic and reckless brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) in the Wittenborns cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson)  who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine. Later the bride-to-be confesses her true feelings about Harris to Ann. However  when Ann meets Harris  she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with Buddy. Meanwhile Anns daughters  the insecure and unstable Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson)  are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved.<br /><br />Evening has one of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie  with magnificent performances. The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother. The locations  costumes  set decoration  cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film. Why motherhood is so important in the story? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together  if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end? It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story.

'Horrendous pillaging of a classic.<br /><br />It wasnt written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him  but he still doesnt help himself at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues; lying about the knives  etc... ) This  in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him  but this somehow doesnt happen just so they can play the mistaken-identity-murder-game later on. Which in itself is also ridiculous: So-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didnt need extending.<br /><br />It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again  but thats about the only small pleasure to be had. Its definitely not a patch on Hitchcock  and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldnt be bothering at all.',neg
'End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies Ive ever seen. Muddling direction  meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes  rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way.<br /><br />Thats not to say End of Days isnt watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nulds latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker  which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S.<br /><br />I wont go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic  but here are several problems with this movie:<br /><br />(SPOILER)<br /><br />After the Devil walks out  the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger  no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire  nothing. How could this happen?<br /><br />Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name Christine York after examining the phrase Christ in New York carved on a victims body  runs the database on the computer and  viola  Christine York  the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /><br />How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnolds character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.<br /><br />All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle?<br /><br />The Devil took a mans body comprising of flesh and blood  yet hes invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically  this is impossible.<br /><br />As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment  Arnolds character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.<br /><br />The Devil is capable of punching the persons brains out and twisting a victims head 180 degree  yet he could not kill Arnolds character as he always intends to.<br /><br />How the Devils object of desires parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.<br /><br />In the sequence thats a rip-off of Speed  Arnold and the Devils object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension  since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.<br /><br />Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall  yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for conveniences sake.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie  after the Devil took over a mans body  all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?<br /><br />Arnolds recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME! are the perfect fodder for MST3K  just as Eraser did with the classic line Youre the luggage!.<br /><br />The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devils object of desire. <br /><br />(END SPOILERS)<br /><br />It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome  and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The directors indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.<br /><br />Hence  End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnolds worst since Hercules in New York. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />',neg
